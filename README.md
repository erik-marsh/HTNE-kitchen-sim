# Learn to Chef

This is an entry for the Hack the Northeast hacakthon (June 5-7, 2020) for the following categories:
* Best Gaming Hack
* Most Viable Startup

Created by Erik Marsh, Daniel Enriquez, and Colin Rogers.

### Summary (Gaming)
This project was created using Unreal Engine 4.25.1. Some assets were provided by the Unreal Engine Marketplace, and others were created in Blender.

### Summary (Startup)
This is an application designed to teach people how to cook in a risk-free environment.
By risk-free, we mean that there is no risk of ruining ingredients by making mistakes.
Additionally, the user does not need to pay for ingredients, which will be useful for those in a low-income situation.
The target audience for this application is people under 40 with a desire to learn cooking skills that they have otherwise not learned.

### Business Plan Outline


### How to run
* Install Unreal Engine
* Open `kitchen_sim.uproject` with Unreal Engine
